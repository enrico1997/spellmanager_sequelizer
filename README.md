     # Node Express Handlebars Sequelizer

### Overview

In this assignment, I extended the previous week's work and created a spellbook logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and Sequelizer. Following proper MVC design pattern, I used Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate the HTML. The application was deployed on Heroku and can be found in https://spellmanager.herokuapp.com/spells.

### Application Details

* Standard Book of Spells! is a *Harry Potter* inspired app that lets users input the names of spells they'd like to cast.

* Whenever a user submits a spell's name, the app will display the spell on the left side of the page -- waiting to be cast.

* Each spell in the waiting area also has a `Cast it!` button. When the user clicks it, the spell will move to the right side of the page.

* The app stores every spell in a database, whether cast or not.
